Known Bugs
------------------

1. After --wait, subcommand exit status is printed correctly but argument list is garbled.
   This is a particularly nasty bug, since argv[] index value for each arg is listed correctly,
   however, printing argv[index] always results in a garbled value. On the other hand, --verbose
   lists the --command as well as it's arguments correctly every time, and arguments passed to
   execvp are also correct, and they all refer to the same argv variable. 

2. Arguments to subcommands are passed correctly but short options create an error message on
   getopt_long.
