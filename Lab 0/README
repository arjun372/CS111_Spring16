Implementation details
----------------------

1. If multiple --input or --output parameters are supplied, the most recent one
   is used. The previous ones are discarded.

2. Macro FILE_MODE is set to 0644 in main.c. Feel free to change it for other
   file permission settings.

3. Macro DEBUG is set to 0 in main.c. In order to have a line-by-line verbose
   output of the input arguments, set DEBUG to 1.

4.

Known Bugs
------------------

1. After --wait, subcommand exit status is printed correctly but argument list is garbled.
   This is a particularly nasty bug, since argv[] index value for each arg is listed correctly,
   however, printing argv[index] always results in a garbled value. On the other hand, --verbose
   lists the --command as well as it's arguments correctly every time, and arguments passed to
   execvp are also correct, and they all refer to the same argv variable.

2. Arguments to subcommands are passed correctly but short options create an error message on
   getopt_long.
