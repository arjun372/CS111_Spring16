---------
Lab4-B-1
---------
Heart-rate information for the patient is being send to the server. Both the
heart-rate value and the IP address of the client is visible in plaintext.
Implication : Since the message is in plaintext, it can be seen by anyone
sniffing for data-packets on the network.

---------
Lab4-B-2
---------
The entire UDP data can be seen in the output of the packet sniffer. This
includes the IP address and the heart-rate for out patient. This is a major
privacy loophole as all this data is publicly visible.

---------
Lab4-B-3
---------
Upon running 'set_rate 5', a command was sent to the UDP server on port 8000 in
plaintext format. The UDP server responded with a message indicating that the
rate had been updated. Now the output rate has changed from 3 to 5 and the
terminal window for the udp_client displays this new change (3 to 5).

---------
Lab4-B-4
---------
The attacking program (3rd party) has cleverly changed the sampling rate of the
heart-rate sensor from 5 to 15. This demonstrates a security vulnerability
allows external malicious programs to interfere and disrupt communication.

---------
Lab4-D-1
---------
Examine the output that is being sent to the server, and write a brief description of that
output.


---------
Lab4-B-2
---------
Examine the output from the packet sniffer, and write a brief description how
this is different from the output you saw in part B.

---------
Lab4-B-3
---------
Write a brief description of how the output changes.


---------
Lab4-D-1
---------
Examine the output, and write a brief description of how the output changes.
