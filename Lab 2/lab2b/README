Lab 2b - Complex Critical Sections

Files
------

1. Makefile     - Commands for building the executable & creating a tarball for
                  submission.

2. SortedList.h - Header file containing interfaces for linked list operations.

3. SortedList.c - source file that compiles cleanly (with no errors or warnings)
                  and implements insert, delete, lookup, and length methods for
                  a sorted doubly linked list (described in the provided header
                  file, including correct placement of pthread_yield calls).

4. lab2b.c      - source file compiles cleanly (with no errors or warnings), and
                  implements the specified command line options (--threads,
                  --iterations, --yield, --sync), drives one or more parallel
                  threads that do operations on a shared linked list, and
                  reports on the final list and performance.


5. graph1.png   - Illustrates the average time per unprotected operation vs
                  number of iteration (single thread).

6. graph2.png   - (corrected) average time per operation (for unprotected,
                  mutex, and spin-lock) vs number of threads.

7. README   :: [[ self ]]

Extra features
---------------

1. Optional argument '--verbose' can be passed to the program to display a log
   as the code executes. Helpful in debugging.

--------------
Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2B.1A: Explain the variation in time per operation vs the number of iterations?







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2B.1B: How would you propose to correct for this effect?







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2B.2A: Compare the variation in time per protected operation vs the number of
       threads in Project 2B and in Project 2A.  Explain the difference.






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thresholds
-------------

How many parallel threads & iterations does it take to fairly consistently
demonstrate a problem? -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs - THESE BUGS DO NOT AFFECT THE CORRECTNESS OR ROBUSTNESS OF THE
             THIS PROGRAM WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT SPEC.

   1. Unidentified memory leak from pthread_create when --threads are > 1. This
      does not happen every-time, and the size of leaked memory remains constant
      irrespective of thread_count.

      Valgrind reports the following error :
