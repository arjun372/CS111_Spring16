Testing Methodology
----------------

The program is broken up into "handle..." functions and "write#" functions that
complete, respectively, populating of the respective structures and writing
those structures to the output file.
Each of these functions were tested individually, with the verbose option, to
ensure that each structure is properly filled from the respective .csv files.
Similar checks were also completed on the "write" functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs - None, although our code runs quite slowly.
