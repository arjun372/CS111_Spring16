Lab 3a - File System Dump

------
Files
------

1. Makefile     - Commands for building the executable & creating a tarball for
                  submission.

2. SortedList.h - Header file containing interfaces for linked list operations.

3. SortedList.c - source file that compiles cleanly (with no errors or warnings)
                  and implements insert, delete, lookup, and length methods for
                  a sorted doubly linked list (described in the provided header
                  file, including correct placement of pthread_yield calls).

4. lab2b.c      - source file compiles cleanly (with no errors or warnings), and
                  implements the specified command line options (--threads,
                  --iterations, --yield, --sync), drives one or more parallel
                  threads that do operations on a shared linked list, and
                  reports on the final list and performance.


5. graph1.png   - Illustrates the average time per unprotected operation vs
                  number of iteration (single thread).

6. graph2.png   - (corrected) average time per operation (for unprotected,
                  mutex, and spin-lock) vs number of threads.

7. README   :: [[ self ]]

Extra features
---------------

1. Optional argument '--verbose' can be passed to the program to display a log
   as the code executes. Helpful in debugging.
