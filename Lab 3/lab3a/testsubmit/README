Issues with pread :: We spent a LOT of time trying to debug code that had
                     errors due to enddianess of data that was read thru pread.
                     Unfortunately, the documentation did not mention anything
                     about byte-order. Our shift OPs were incorrect until we
                     changed our byte ordering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs - None, although our code runs quite slowly (about 16sec).
