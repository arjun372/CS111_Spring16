Extra features

1. Optional argument '--verbose' can be passed to the program to display a log
   as the code executes. Helpful in debugging.

2. I have used atexit() extensively and it has been very helpful in streamlining
   the exit subroutines.

3. Support for N worker pthreads -> should be helpful in managing a multi-process
   telnet client-server implementation.
