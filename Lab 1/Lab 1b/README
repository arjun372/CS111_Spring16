Use of Slip Day : 1 Day
-----------------
Used 1 slip day to ensure that the file encryption is handled correctly. Code
debugging took additional time. 

-----------
Known Bugs
-----------

Terminal in NON_CANONICAL mode shows extraneous tabs(?) upon carriage return. 

---------------
Extra features
---------------

1. Optional argument '--verbose' can be passed to the program to display a log
   as the code executes. Helpful in debugging.

2. Encryption uses 128-bit TwoFish CFB cipher via the mcrypt library.
