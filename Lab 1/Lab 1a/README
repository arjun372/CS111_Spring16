1. Makefile :: Commands for building the executable, running checks, and creating
               a tarball for submission.

2. main.c   :: Source code that implements 'lab0' as per the specification.

3. screenshot_1_fault.png :: Shows the segmentation fault.

4. screenshot_2_backtrace.png :: shows the stack backtrace

5. screenshot_3_breakpoint.png :: shows the breakpoint before the code is executed

6. screenshot_4_NULL.png :: shows that the 'ptr' variable is 0x0 (NULL)

7. README :: (self)

Smoke tests
------------

There are a total of 5 smoke tests, all of which ensure that program behavior
is defined as per the specification.

CHECK_1 : Ensure that the output file is generated, indicating that the creation
          flags executed correctly for open(2) and that the output file is readable.

CHECK_2 : Checks to see if the input file was copied correctly to the output file.

CHECK_3 : Checks to see if the arguments and their options are parsed correctly.
   &      This is done by flipping the order of the arguments and ensuring that
CHECK_4   the output does not differ in anyway or that the program does not exit
          with an error or segmentation fault.

CHECK_5 : trap function checks to see if the segmentation fault occurs as intended.

CHECK_6 : Catches the segmentation fault and ensures that the program continues
          to execute correctly and outputs the correct files.

Implementation details
----------------------

1. If multiple --input or --output parameters are supplied, the most recent one
   is used. The previous ones are discarded.

2. Macro FILE_MODE is set to 0644 in main.c. Feel free to change it for other
   file permission settings.

---------------
Extra features
---------------

1. Optional argument '--verbose' can be passed to the program to display a log
   as the code executes. Helpful in debugging code.

2. The code performs additional checks, such as checking whether the supplied
   argument for an option is actually an option or not. It would be illegal to
   an option as an argument. This has been implemented in the 'isOption' function.
